## Interesting Code
The most interesting code that I wrote is the code used for the signing in page and the registration page because I was able to take all of the techniques I learned and bring them together to make something I was happy with. It took a lot of trial and error.

I relied on referencing ideas and techniques that others used in order to successfully create what I wanted.
